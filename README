  Example syntax:

    # assignment

    a <: 10;
    b <: 11;

    # operations

    a <: 3 + 5;
    a <: a = b;
    a <: a < b;
    a <: b > a;

    # functions

    # @ refers to the current function
    # every function returns @ by default
    # unless you assign @ another value

    factorial <: (n){
      if [n < 2] then [@ <: 1] else [@ <: n * @(n - 1)];
    };

    tenth_factorial <: factorial(10);
